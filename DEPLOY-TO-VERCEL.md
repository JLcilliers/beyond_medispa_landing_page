# Deploy Beyond Medispa to Vercel (Recommended)

Since GitHub Pages is having issues with the React app, I recommend using Vercel for deployment. It's free and works perfectly with React apps.

## Option 1: Deploy with Vercel CLI (Easiest)

1. **Install Vercel CLI:**
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

2. **Deploy:**
```bash
cd beyond-medispa
vercel
```

3. **Follow the prompts:**
- Login/Signup when prompted
- Choose "Deploy"
- Accept all defaults
- Your site will be live in 30 seconds!

## Option 2: Deploy via GitHub Integration

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/new

2. **Click:** "Import Git Repository"

3. **Connect GitHub** and select: `JLcilliers/beyond_medispa_landing_page`

4. **Configure:**
   - Framework Preset: Vite
   - Root Directory: `./` (leave empty)
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`

5. **Click:** "Deploy"

## Your Live Site

After deployment, you'll get a URL like:
- `https://beyond-medispa.vercel.app`
- Or your custom domain if you set one

## Why Vercel?

✅ **Works perfectly with React/Vite**
✅ **Automatic HTTPS**
✅ **Global CDN**
✅ **Instant deployments**
✅ **Free tier is generous**
✅ **Auto-deploys on git push**

## Alternative: Netlify

If you prefer Netlify:

1. **Go to:** https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. **Drag the `dist` folder** to the browser
3. **Done!** Your site is live

Or connect GitHub:
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect GitHub
4. Select repository
5. Deploy!

## Current Issue with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is not loading the JavaScript and CSS files properly for the React app. This is a common issue with SPAs on GitHub Pages. Vercel and Netlify handle this automatically.

## Local Testing

Your app works perfectly locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Visit: http://localhost:5173/

The site has all features working:
- Hero section with gradient background
- Navigation menu
- All content sections
- Responsive design
- Animations

Choose Vercel or Netlify for hassle-free deployment!
