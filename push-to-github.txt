# After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

# Option 1: If you created a repository named "beyond-medispa-landing"
git remote add origin https://github.com/JLcilliers/beyond-medispa-landing.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# Option 2: If you used a different repository name, replace "beyond-medispa-landing" with your repo name:
# git remote add origin https://github.com/JLcilliers/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
# git branch -M main
# git push -u origin main

# To verify the remote was added:
git remote -v

# If you need to change the remote URL later:
# git remote set-url origin https://github.com/JLcilliers/NEW-REPO-NAME.git
